#  This project belongs to Figo Alessandro Lehman

Things to Note:
1. Tried my best looking for CircularStd (Semibold/Demi) on the internet but can't find it, so it is replaced with bold
2. Search history feature gets added when you tap on the song (not on the add/remove playlist button)
3. Figma says to implement light mode but make the UI stay the same, which i assume to keep the same UI when device change from dark to light mode or vice versa (by avoiding using the system color)
4. Remove song from playlist feature is improvisation to remove one song from a playlist, it can only be done via the same view as add song to playlist
